# Heitor Santos Ferreira  

I'm a multidisciplinary professional passionate about technology, economics, and innovation. Currently studying Computer Engineering at FESA, I build on prior training in Mechatronics, Digital Arts, and Chinese. 
At Santander Digital Services, I work as a Data Engineer, developing end-to-end data solutions using Python, ELK stack, Azure, DataBricks, Kafka, and Hadoop. I also create full-stack applications in Python, C++, C#, and Java, focused on scalability and performance. My journey includes roles at Santander Brazil and research at Santa Food, where I develop tech for ecovillages and regenerative microterritories. Certified in ElasticSearch and DataBricks, I have expertise in SQL, NoSQL, DevOps, and secure development. Fluent in English, with advanced Spanish and basic Chinese. I believe knowledge transforms realities—explore my projects and let’s connect.
